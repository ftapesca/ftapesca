- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ftapesca
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in DAIKIN COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning THE BASICS
- I own an old daikin system, but the esxternal unit (Compressor-condenser) is having problem with the fan control cards (they become hot and fail). I am looking to use a substitute for the controller card or to use the internal units (evaporators) with another condenser unit, even if it is no daikin.
